Case Study: Building a Data Pipeline using Medallion Architecture for "ACME" Inc.

"ACME" Inc. is a distributor of clothes and footwear, selling products across the US and internationally. They want to improve their understanding of sales and margin performance through a Lakehouse architecture. 
You are tasked with creating a data pipeline that processes raw data into meaningful Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) using the Medallion Architecture. The goal is to focus on backend processes, from data ingestion to transformation and generating KPIs that will later be utilized for Power BI reports.

Objective
Develop a Sales Analytics application to track sales, margins, and other key business metrics, accessible to executives, product managers, and sales reps. This solution will enable the company to:
1.	Analyze sales figures and compare them year-over-year.
2.	Measure and track sales margins.
3.	Analyze sales data by various dimensions (e.g., Region, Country, Division, Product Line, Product Group, and Customer).
4.	Compute average sales per transaction and per customer.
5.	Follow up on customer growth over time (e.g., Year-To-Date vs. Last Year-To-Date).

The raw data is provided in an Excel file, which will be used as the source for building the data pipeline. The file contains various tables such as Orders, OrderDetatails, Customers, Products, Divisions, and Shipments.
